# Aerospace-Engineering

Welcome to this Aerospace Engineering repository! This collection encompasses various aspects of aerospace engineering, including theoretical concepts, practical applications, system designs and software usage that would give you a taste of this expansive field. I use this as a reference point if i forget anything or need a helping hand. Have fun looking around and lemme know if you find any discrepancy or wanna chat a bit of aero! xP

## Repository Structure

The repository is roughly  organized into the following directories:

- **Aircrafts**: Information and resources related to fixed-wing aircraft design, aerodynamics, and performance analysis.

- **Helicopters**: Materials focusing on rotary-wing aircraft, including helicopter dynamics, control, and design principles.

- **Modelling & Simulation**: Tools and examples for simulating aerospace systems, such as flight dynamics models and computational simulations.

- **Rockets and Spacecrafts**: Resources covering rocketry, spacecraft design, propulsion systems, and mission planning.

- **Systems Engineering**: Insights into the interdisciplinary approach of systems engineering applied to aerospace projects, including lifecycle analysis and integration processes.

- **Theory**: Fundamental theories and principles that underpin aerospace engineering, including fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and structural analysis.

- **UAV**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) design, control systems, and applications.
