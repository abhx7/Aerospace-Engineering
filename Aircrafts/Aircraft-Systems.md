## Learning Resources

Books:
- [“Aircraft Systems: Mechanical, Electrical, and Avionics Subsystems Integration” by Ian Moir and Allan Seabridge](https://github.com/abhx7/Aerospace-Engineering/blob/main/Aircrafts/Aircraft%20Systems%20Mechanical%2C%20Electrical%2C%20and%20Avionics%20Subsystems%20Integration%20-%20Ian%20Moir%20and%20Allan%20Seabridge.pdf)

Videos:
- Watch technical walkthroughs of aircraft systems on YouTube or aerospace channels.

Simulations:
- Use Simulink/Simscape for basic simulations of systems like control surfaces or hydraulic systems.

### Tips for Learning
- Focus on understanding system interdependencies.
- Use open resources from aviation authorities like FAA and EASA for technical insights.
- Study real-life case studies of aircraft systems.
