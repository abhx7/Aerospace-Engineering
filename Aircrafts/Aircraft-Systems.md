Learning Resources

Books:
“Introduction to Aircraft Systems” by Ian Moir and Allan Seabridge
“Aircraft Systems: Mechanical, Electrical, and Avionics Subsystems Integration” by Ian Moir, Allan Seabridge, and Malcolm Jukes

Videos:
Watch technical walkthroughs of aircraft systems on YouTube or aerospace channels.

Simulations:
Use Simulink/Simscape for basic simulations of systems like control surfaces or hydraulic systems.

sTips for Learning
Focus on understanding system interdependencies.
Use open resources from aviation authorities like FAA and EASA for technical insights.
Study real-life case studies of aircraft systems.
