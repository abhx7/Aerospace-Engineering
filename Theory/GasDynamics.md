A local thermodynamic state is fixed by any two thermodynamic variables (P, T, s, rho)

First Law of Thermodynamics

Enthalpy equation

Heat capacities at constant volume (Cv) and constant pressure (Cp)

Maxwell's relations

Acoustics 
= assume no viscous dissipation, hence isentropic flow
- pressure wave equation derivatioon through mass conservation and euler equations; similarly for velocity wave equation
- speed of sound relations


 Shock
 
 Mach number
 
 Supersonic flow past an object
