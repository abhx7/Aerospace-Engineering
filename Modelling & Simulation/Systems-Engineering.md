# Systems Engineering

## Awareness of Systems Engineering and SysML

- Basics of Systems Engineering
  - Definition and scope of systems engineering
  - Lifecycle stages: Concept, design, testing, operation
  - Requirements analysis and management
  
- SysML Overview
  - Core diagrams: Use case, activity, sequence, and block definition diagrams
  - How SysML helps in system architecture and integration
  
- Application to Aerospace
  - Functional analysis of aircraft systems
  - System-level modeling and validation

## Books:
- “Systems Engineering and Analysis” by Benjamin S. Blanchard and Wolter J. Fabrycky
- “A Practical Guide to SysML” by Sanford Friedenthal, Alan Moore, and Rick Steiner

## Tools:
- Tools like MagicDraw or Cameo for hands-on SysML modeling.
  
### Tips for Learning
- Focus on understanding system requirements and relationships.
- Practice creating SysML diagrams for small systems like a car or drone.
- Look into standards like ARP4754A for systems development in aviation.
